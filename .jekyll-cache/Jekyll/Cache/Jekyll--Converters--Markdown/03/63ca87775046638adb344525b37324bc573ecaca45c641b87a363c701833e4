I"‹	<p>Just a quick note to let you know I am now hosting a podcast together with <a href="http://stefhamerlinck.be">Stef Hamerlinck</a>. It is called <a href="https://opgemerkt.simplecast.com/">Opgemerkt</a>. In the podcast we both speak Dutch.</p>

<p>I did some attempts to podcasting before, but never felt comfortable releasing anything. This time however it feels right. Itâ€™s good to finally discover the other side of the medium.</p>

<p>The plan is to release a new episode each week. Stef and me discuss one or two topics that caught our eye in the world of branding, communication, design or digital. This format allows me to learn something remarkable each week from Stef, and I hope the same can be said from his side.</p>

<p>We donâ€™t do edits and we donâ€™t prepare extensively. Above all it has to stay fun, spontaneous and quick to release. We aim for 25 minute episodes. From my own experience listening to podcasts, this is the perfect length.</p>

<p>We did four episodes so far. You can subscribe on <a href="https://podcasts.apple.com/be/podcast/opgemerkt/id1496559514?l=nl&amp;i=1000465229575">Apple Podcasts</a>, <a href="https://open.spotify.com/show/5cDsraxmbx7B0B33O1xz5L?si=WipTG2yJQOu0tQIT-v5wxw">Spotify</a> or any other popular podcasting channel. There is also <a href="https://opgemerkt.simplecast.com">a web link to the podcast</a>.</p>

<p>I will try to update this page weekly as new episodes become available. However, if you want to get automatic updates and be the first to know when a new episode is live, itâ€™s best to subscribe using any of the above linked channels, or <a href="https://twitter.com/bytte">follow me on Twitter</a>.</p>

<p>Any feedback is welcome. Weâ€™re also on <a href="https://twitter.com/opgemerktpod">Twitter as Opgemerkt</a>.</p>
