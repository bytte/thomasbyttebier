I"<p>Finally, a redesign. It was about time. It’s hard to believe I never changed my previous site’s look since it was released mid 2008. What a shame.</p>

<p>So much has changed on the internet since then. The single most important thing probably being the fact that we’re now connected 24/7 through handheld devices. No new web technology, HTML update or visual trend can beat the impact of that.</p>

<p>But even more has changed on a personal level. I’m in my thirties now and I’ve sure had my share of misfortune. But I’ve been on two foreign continents and I have a truly beautiful kid now. I work for better clients, produce better work and have less but better friends, so that’s great.</p>

<p>It’s all things that shaped my vision on life in general and web design in particular. This renewed site is an extension of that: much simpler and to the point. It states what I do and what I believe in. Nothing fancy. Also: the domain name is now my own name. No more quaint company name, it’s just me anyway. (I’ve archived <a href="http://thomasbyttebier.be/v2">the old version</a> much to my own embarrassment.)</p>

<p>This site runs on my new simple CMS of choice: <a href="http://getkirby.com">Kirby</a>. Coming from an <a href="http://expressionengine.com">ExpressionEngine</a> background, Kirby is a delight for the small personal website this is. Kirby’s biggest plus is the absence of features: no database, no extensive configuration, no control panel. Just well-structured text files, easy updating and full design freedom. Love that.</p>

<p>In the next few weeks I’ll take the time to update the contents of my portfolio pages and do a few required tweaks here and there. <a href="/about">Get in touch</a> if you feel like. I’d sure appreciate it.</p>
