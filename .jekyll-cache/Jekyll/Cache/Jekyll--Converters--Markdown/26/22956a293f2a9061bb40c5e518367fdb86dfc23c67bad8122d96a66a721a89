I"ž<p>I was invited to give a presentation on the topic of user interface design at <a href="http://www.luca-arts.be">Luca School of Arts</a> in Gent, past Monday.
<a href="http://www.slideshare.net/bytte/characteristics-of-an-awesome-user-interface">Hereâ€™s the slides</a>. I tried to make them more understandable to those who didnâ€™t attend by adding short notes.</p>

<div class="o-media-container o-media-container--4-3 o-media-container--slideshare"><iframe class="o-media-container__media" src="//www.slideshare.net/slideshow/embed_code/45489730" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no" allowfullscreen=""> </iframe></div>

<p>In the coming weeks Iâ€™d enjoy elaborating on what I show in the slides, here on my blog. Thereâ€™s a lot of things in the deck that I find to be a recurring point of discussion for every new UI design job I take on. Documenting them may be a helpful thing to do.</p>
