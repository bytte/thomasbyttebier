I"|<p>I was happy to see <a href="http://madebywolf.com">Wolf</a> launch a community-sourced online T-shirt store for grown-ups a few days ago. I was finally able to design the one shirt I always wanted but never found:</p>

<p><img src="/assets/images/2013-08-22/shape-square-men.jpg" alt="a big black square on a plain white t-shirt" /></p>

<p>Yes. A big black square on a plain white tee.</p>

<p><a href="http://all.madebywolf.com/shop/shirt/shape-square">Pre-order if you like it.</a> Available for men and women. However, we need 20 pre-orders in 20 days before the shirt is printed and shipped. Iâ€™m crossing my fingers here.</p>
