I"(<p>November saw the birth of two online projects that will have a significant impact on how we build and design websites. It’s two sites that tell an important story but in a totally different way.</p>

<p>The first one is the online transcript of a presentation <a href="http://frankchimero.com">Frank Chimero</a> gave at <a href="http://buildconf.com">Build conference</a>. It’s called <a href="http://frankchimero.com/what-screens-want/">What Screens Want</a> and is not only a really well-written and thought-out essay, it’s also beautifully laid out. It’s an essential read for every web designer.</p>

<p>The second remarkable website is called <a href="http://apps.npr.org/tshirt/">Planet Money Makes A T-shirt</a>. It’s the perfect symbiosis between good story telling and great web design. The moment I clicked the link I was sucked into the story. The design and development are impressively invisible, yet there when you need them. Very well done.</p>

<p>You can tell it’s two websites I’m really excited about. Just about every aspect of them feels right and that’s quite an accomplishment.</p>

<p>It’s sites like these that raise the bar in web design, online journalism and our entire industry. It’s projects that question what we do and how we can do things better.</p>

<p>Yes.</p>
