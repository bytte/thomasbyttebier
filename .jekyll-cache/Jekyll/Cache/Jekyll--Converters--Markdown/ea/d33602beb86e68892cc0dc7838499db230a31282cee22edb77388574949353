I"L<p>I once again spent two great days at the <a href="http://fronteers.nl/congres">Fronteers conference</a> in Amsterdam this past October.</p>

<p>As always, there were many good talks on front-end development, yet two presentations stood out to me. They weren’t about the newest front-end techniques and most certainly weren’t filled with code examples. They both just showed a down-to-earth speaker passionate about his profession:</p>

<p><a href="http://www.lucasfonts.com/about/">Lucas de Groot</a>, on designing typefaces:</p>

<p>And <a href="http://ia.net">Oliver Reichenstein</a>, on responsive typography:</p>

<p>Very inspiring. Had to share.</p>
