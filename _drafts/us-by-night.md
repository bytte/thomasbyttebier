(This post is the written version of a talk I gave together with [Thomas Léon](https://basedesign.com/people/thomas-leon/) at [Us By Night](http://www.usbynight.be) in Antwerp, on November 23, 2017.)

In his article titled [UX global trends might be narrowing our minds](https://medium.com/@alemasferrer/ux-global-trends-might-be-narrowing-our-minds-10aebb99de4f), author [Alejandro Masferrer](http://www.alejandromasferrer.com) writes that especially in digital, everything is  starting to look the same. Every interface looks similar.

And of course Alejandro is right. Have a look at some of the most used apps of today.

They essentially all look the same: bold type for titles, pure line icons for navigation, full black-and-white UI, circular avatars… It's like they are all apps under the same brand. Alejandro interestingly calls this phenomenon sameness.

Sameness clearly appears in more areas than just user interface design. It's happening in all creative disciplines. The apps displayed before were probably designed in studios that look like the ones pictured below.

There is a reasonable chance that if you're reading this, you work in an office that looks somehow similar. And if you had coffee outdoors today, you may have sipped it in a shop that looks very much like this:

Chances are high that you have a phone in your pocket that looks similar to these ones:

Hell, even salad packaging all looks the same nowadays:

## Why is everything looking the same?

What is going on here? Why is this happening? Why is everything looking exactly the same nowadays?

We think part of the reason lies in the fact that creativity has always been shaped and framed by constraints. Contrary to popular belief, there is no such thing as free creativity. It is a myth.

There are basically four kinds of constraints that shape our creativity. They kick in as soon as we are trying to solve a creative problem. They are inherently part of the design process.

The first set of constraints are defined by our personality and character. It is the education we got, our personal background, our habits... As an example, consider a designer that has been working successfully for decades using only the five typefaces he knows best. Of course this personal history will influence the design he creates next.

The second set of constraints are the ones that are imposed upon us. It's the task's briefing, but obviously also the timeframe and the budget we have been allocated. It's only normal that spending 3 weeks on a creative brief will yield different results than doing the same job in only 3 days.

The third type of constraints is the ones we decide ourselves as a creative. When we are trying to solve a problem, early on we will decide on a certain approach, a format, medium and a style. This will have an impact on the final result: designing a printed poster requires a different approach than creating a website or a logo.

The last set of constraints are the ones that come from the outside world: language, trends, available technology, rules of society... As an example: today you could think about designing with VR in the browser, while years ago that was just technically impossible.

All those constraints set a certain frame. Your creativity must happen right in there.

Most of us will answer the problem right in the middle of the frame, because that is where you address the needs perfectly. Your solution will be accurate, but not challenging.

![]()

Some of us will probably try to challenge the constraints and provide an answer that is nowhere near the frame. It may feel extremely creative but it won't address the needs very well. It's going to be a bad solution.

![]()

Very few of us will answer right next to the frame. Close enough to be relevant, yet far enough to challenge the constraints.

![]()

Now this is where things get super interesting. Because by doing this, we potentially reset the frame of constraints.

Before 1933, subway maps were relatively hard to read because designers always drew them on an accurate geographical map. It seemed the logical thing to do.

![]()

After the thirties however, subway maps of major cities worldwide started to look much clearer. That is because they didn't try to be 100% geographically accurate anymore.

![]()

What happened? Harry Beck. Beck brilliantly designed a new kind of map for the London Underground. First introduced in 1933, the map focuses on what matters most to people using the Underground: the tube lines, stops and exchanges. Beck also added the river Thames to the map, an important point of recognition for most Londoners.

![]()

What is interesting about the 1933 map is that it distorts the train lines, relying only on horizontal, vertical and perfectly diagonal lines. Stops are spaced similarly as well, while in reality the distances vary greatly.

Beck’s solution to the problem at hand was right next to the frame of constraints of that time. Yet it has proven very appropriate and it remained virtually intact for over 80 years with only minor updates. Its brilliance lies in what it doesn’t show: streets, buildings, curves in lines, and actual distances between stops. This approach declutters the map and makes it more usable for most travelers.

...

Fast forward to 2010. On the web, something big happened that had a lasting impact on website design. Less than 3 years before, Apple had released its first iPhone. Smartphone adoption rates went crazy and soon it was common for people to surf the web on tiny screens.

Brands had to adapt to this new type of user. Some created standalone iOS and Android apps that were basically a mobile version of their website, others created a new and dedicated mobile version of their existing website. Whatever solution they opted for, it meant content duplication and additional development costs.

But in 2010, using a combination of forthcoming technologies, Ethan Marcotte found a brilliant solution to the problem. He developed a simple approach that allowed designers to make the same website look great on all kinds of devices: from small smartphone touch screens to large desktop screens.

In 2011 Marcotte and his team designed and developed The Boston Globe, the first real, content-heavy responsive website.

Because their solution was so accurate, they reshaped the constraints of designing a website forever since. They upped the game. After 2010, as good as all new websites were designed responsively.

## Globalized design

Globalization in design ensures that good ideas, like the ones I talked about before, spread super fast. And of course also the previously discussed constraints of creativity travel equally fast.

All of us have access to the same cultural references at the same time, wherever we are in the world.

![]()

If we all read the same blogs, and look for inspiration using the same search terms and exactly the same tools, then it’s only natural we somehow end up finding similar solutions.

![]()

Basically you can say that globalization has created a nearly identical frame of constraints for every designer facing the same creative brief.

It is part of the reason why all subway maps worldwide look the same. If Harry Beck solved a problem so accurately in London in 1933, and subway map designers worldwide (facing exactly the same problem) have instant access to that solution, why wouldn't they follow Beck's example?

Moreover, people traveling worldwide start to expect a subway map to look similar to the ones they know. It helps them navigate and understand that map more quickly. This is important as it means a similarly designed map addresses the needs more accurately now than a map that looks different.

And look, all subway maps look the same everywhere in the world...

And look, all coffee shops look the same everywhere in the world...

![]()

I admit that when traveling, in need of coffee, I may look for a bar like this because somehow I expect that coffee will taste great in such a place.

Especially in digital the same idea rings true. And it has even grown into a powerful design principle: if we want people to be able to interact and understand our interfaces, we have to build them similar to others. It’s what people expect nowadays. It's what makes them more usable.

This famous quote by Danish usability expert Jakob Nielsen underlines the thought:

> Users spend most of their time on other sites. This means that users prefer your site to work the same way as all the other sites they already know.

## Is sameness a problem?

Is this a problem? From a branding perspective, you could say that yes, this is problematic. Branding is all about identification. Just like people, brands have the fundamental need to be noticed. Yet the only thing that allows people to identify you from your peers is your difference. If Waldo wouldn’t have the red and white hat or the glasses, no one would ever be able to find him.

![]()

To identify someone, you need to be able to differentiate that person from the pack. And herein lies the problem with sameness: it rules out individuality and identification. If all brands look and behave the same, why would customers choose yours over the others?

However, from a consumer perspective, you could say it’s not a problem at all that everything looks the same. Uniformity is convenient even. If you ever arrived in an international airport where you cannot interpret the written language, you will be happy there is worldwide uniformity. Icons like the ones pictured below are a godsend in this scenario. They are probably the only reason you can find your way.

![]()

And when you get out of the airport, trying to get somewhere fast, you'll be happy to see a subway map that is designed just like all the subway maps you already know, in Harry Beck fashion. With a row of people waiting in line behind you, you will be relieved to see the subway ticket vending machines operate similar to the ones you already know.

Standardization is convenient. This is a big reason why highly inventive and creative user interfaces are often very hard to use. The solutions they provide are just too distant from the current frame of constraints. If you look at those kinds of interfaces from a usability perspective, they are simply bad. They are even belittling, as they will make your users feel stupid. Here's an important quote from Donald Norman (from his renowned book The Design of Everyday Things) underlining this theory:

> If people don’t know how to use your interface, they will blame themselves. They will feel stupid.

Of course we don't want that. Seen from this point of view, it's pretty clear: designers should learn to embrace sameness. Sameness in how websites, apps, ticket vending machines and other interfaces work, makes them easier to use. It's as simple as that. And if you've ever conducted usability tests, you know this is true.

## The paradox of sameness in branding

And so we arrive at an apparent paradox: on the one hand brands have the need to be different. But on the other hand, consumers want brands to behave and look the same, so they are predictable and usable. It makes them feel not stupid. This basically means brands also have the need to be similar.

A couple of years ago, our very own studio website looked like this:

![]()

There was some unusual things going on on our home page, and it looked different for sure. Especially the navigation pattern was quite weird. We noticed quite some visitors struggled. To make it more usable we redid our website a while ago. Now it looks like this:

![]()

It certainly looks more professional. People find it easier to navigate and understand what Base is all about. But by doing the change we also realized that we started to look exactly the same as our competitors:
