[Protime](http://protime.eu) builds workforce management software. I was consulted as user interface designer in 2010–2012 as they decided to bring their desktop software to the web.

I did tons of research, sketched interactions, prototyped, designed flows, performed usability tests and finally created a user-friendly user interface.

    src="{{ site.baseurl }}{{ page.imgpath }}protime-dashboard-small.png" alt="The Protime dashboard UI"
    srcset="{{ site.baseurl }}{{ page.imgpath }}protime-dashboard-small.png 400w,
            {{ site.baseurl }}{{ page.imgpath }}protime-dashboard-extralarge.png 1007w"
    sizes="(min-width: 1007px) 1007px,
           95vw">

Here's a quick glance at a few interactive details I designed for the web app. Everything was meticulously planned, researched, sketched, tested, designed and coded.

<img
    class="u-media-unconstrained-height c-screenshot"
    src="{{ site.baseurl }}{{ page.imgpath }}protime-user-small.png" alt="Screenshot of the Protime web app interface"
    srcset="{{ site.baseurl }}{{ page.imgpath }}protime-user-small.png 400w,
            {{ site.baseurl }}{{ page.imgpath }}protime-user-medium.png 800w,
            {{ site.baseurl }}{{ page.imgpath }}protime-user-large.png 950w,
            {{ site.baseurl }}{{ page.imgpath }}protime-user-extralarge.gif 1006w"
    sizes="(min-width: 1006px) 1006px,
           95vw">

The main goal was making Protime's users more productive. Everything I did was carefully researched and designed to help them reach that goal.

<img
    class="u-media-unconstrained-height c-screenshot"
    src="{{ site.baseurl }}{{ page.imgpath }}protime-schedule-pattern-small.png" alt="Screenshot of the Protime web app interface"
    srcset="{{ site.baseurl }}{{ page.imgpath }}protime-schedule-pattern-small.png 400w,
            {{ site.baseurl }}{{ page.imgpath }}protime-schedule-pattern-medium.png 800w,
            {{ site.baseurl }}{{ page.imgpath }}protime-schedule-pattern-extralarge.png 1007w"
    sizes="(min-width: 1007px) 1007px,
           95vw">

I created many re-usable bits of HTML & CSS, based on the OOCSS principle. It allows Protime's development team to easily build the look of new functionality using my UI guide lines, and prepped chunks of HTML, CSS (and JavaScript).

<img
    class="u-media-unconstrained-height c-screenshot"
    src="{{ site.baseurl }}{{ page.imgpath }}protime-ui-guide-small.png" alt="part of the ui guide for forms"
    srcset="{{ site.baseurl }}{{ page.imgpath }}protime-ui-guide-small.png 452w,
            {{ site.baseurl }}{{ page.imgpath }}protime-ui-guide-medium.png 801w,
            {{ site.baseurl }}{{ page.imgpath }}protime-ui-guide-large.png 999w,
            {{ site.baseurl }}{{ page.imgpath }}protime-ui-guide-extralarge.png 1097w"
    sizes="(min-width: 1097px) 1097px,
           95vw">

Ultimately designing an interface like this is not about making things looks pretty. It's about creating a great user experience. It's about helping users quickly perform daily tasks and reach their goals.

If you like what you see, [let's talk]({{ "/about/" | prepend: site.baseurl }}). I absolutely love this type of work.
