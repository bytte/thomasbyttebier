Picturay lets you share your best holiday spots with friends, by means of pictures. I worked with Picturay in 2014 to redesign their website. Here’s the homepage:

The new design removes all clutter and makes the app easier to use, on all devices. The emphasis is on the photos Picturay users share with their followers.

I researched, sketched interactions and designed new flows to create a more focused user experience. In the end users always appreciate a cleaner interface and mental model that doesn’t get in the way.

I designed a system that allows Picturay’s developers to easily build the look of new functionality using chunks of HTML, CSS and a clear UI design guide.

The new Picturay was designed by me, while a team of web developers put it to life. If you like what you see, let's talk. I absolutely love this type of work.
