Erasmus Hogeschool is one of the larger institutes of higher education based in Brussels. It consists of six departments, including two Schools of Arts. I was approached by Erasmus Hogeschool Brussel to redesign their website. Here’s the home page:

Needless to say, everything is responsive, fully adapting to various screen sizes and resolutions.

As the Erasmus Hogeschool is a very large organisation with many stakeholders and hundreds of pages, it was soon clear I was going to design a graphic system rather than a website. The well-documented system allows web masters at Erasmus and their departments to design web pages themselves in a modular way. An important element of the visual language of the site is the large customizable background area.

The design system is based on a clear grid, the Erasmus brand’s color palette and clean typography. A design guide helps web masters build unique pages in different ways, without compromising the distinct Erasmus look.

Within the boundaries of the design system, the two Schools of Arts can freely experiment and express their own identity. I used chunks of HTML, CSS and JavaScript (using Smacss and OOCSS) to provide web masters with building blocks.

All within constraints of course. Too much freedom leaves users confused, so there’s a set of clear rules. Different types of templates must be used to convey structure and clear navigation.

The design and front-end was handed over to the main Erasmus web master who then implemented everything in the Drupal CMS.
