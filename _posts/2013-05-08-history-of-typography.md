Really loving this beautiful [paper-letter animation](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wOgIkxAfJsk) about the history of fonts and typography. Apparently 291 paper letters went into it, 2454 photographs and 140 hours of work. It shows.

The movie was created by [Ben Barrett-Forrest](http://forrestmedia.org). Respect to you, stranger.
