I once again spent two great days at the [Fronteers conference](http://fronteers.nl/congres) in Amsterdam this past October.

As always, there were many good talks on front-end development, yet two presentations stood out to me. They weren't about the newest front-end techniques and most certainly weren't filled with code examples. They both just showed a down-to-earth speaker passionate about his profession:

[Lucas de Groot](http://www.lucasfonts.com/about/), on designing typefaces:

<div class="o-media-container">
<iframe class="o-media-container__media" src="https://player.vimeo.com/video/77176415" frameborder="0" webkitallowfullscreen mozallowfullscreen allowfullscreen></iframe>
</div>

And [Oliver Reichenstein](http://ia.net), on responsive typography:

<div class="o-media-container">
<iframe class="o-media-container__media" src="https://player.vimeo.com/video/78863241" frameborder="0" webkitallowfullscreen mozallowfullscreen allowfullscreen></iframe>
</div>

Very inspiring. Had to share.
