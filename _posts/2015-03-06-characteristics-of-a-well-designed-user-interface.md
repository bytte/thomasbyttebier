title: Characteristics of a well-designed user interface
date: 2015-03-06
excerpt: Designing a good user interface is like tightrope walking: it’s all about finding the right balance. Here’s the slides for a presentation I gave about UI design at Luca School of Arts.

I was invited to give a presentation on the topic of user interface design at (link: http://www.luca-arts.be text: Luca School of Arts) in Gent, past Monday.
(link: http://www.slideshare.net/bytte/characteristics-of-an-awesome-user-interface text: Here’s the slides), I tried to make them more understandable to those who didn’t attend by adding short notes.

In the coming weeks I’d enjoy elaborating on what I show in the slides, here on my blog. There’s a lot of things in the deck that I find to be a recurring point of discussion for every new UI design job I take on. Documenting them may be a helpful thing to do.
