I'm Thomas Byttebier. I'm a freelance digital designer shaping, teaching and coding the web for almost two decades now. I want the digital products I touch to be delightful to use. I strongly believe good design reduces to the essence.

I design web sites, user experiences, interfaces, apps and all kinds of digital products. I research, talk to users, sketch flows and interactions. I prototype and test them. I simplify. I write accessible and semantic HTML and CSS.

If you want to know more, here's a few key articles on [my blog]({{ site.baseurl }}/blog) that should give you an overall idea of my thoughts on design:
