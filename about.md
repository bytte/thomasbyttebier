I'm Thomas Byttebier. I studied graphic design at the turn of the millennium and quickly fell in love with the interactive nature of the web. I’ve grown to believe that web sites should be as simple and clear as possible. Users shouldn’t have to think to find their way.

Great web design is flexible and accessible to anyone on any device. Great web design affects people in positive ways. Great web design is beautiful.

I work as a freelancer. I design websites, user interfaces and apps. I sketch flows and interactions. I transform them to HTML and CSS. I teach web design and occasionally speak in public. I love art, design and typography.

I live in the beautiful city of Ghent, Belgium. [Send me an email](mailto: thomas@thomasbyttebier.be) if you want to work with me. I'm [bytte on Twitter](https://twitter.com/bytte). Eventually you can reach me by phone: +32 473 93 81 14.
