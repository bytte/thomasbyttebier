<p class="descriptive">I removed all interface clutter to come up with a very clean design. The big project photos are key to the design, to clearly show what Still is about.</p>

<p class="descriptive">The website is responsive. That means its layout perfectly adapts to the varying screen sizes of smartphones, tablets and regular computers. That makes the site perfectly usable on all mobile devices.</p>

<p class="descriptive">Still Architects Eefje and Kaat can easily update the site's content. The back-end code for that is provided by (link: http://getkirby.com text: Kirby), a fantastic light-weight content management system.</p>
