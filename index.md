I am a freelance digital designer, currently working full-time as Digital Director at [Base Design](https://basedesign.com) in Brussels. We do branding for clients as Axel Vervoordt, Delvaux, Art &amp; History Museum, Haus der Kunst, MoMu, Musée Yves Saint Laurent and Fondation Cartier.

I am also lector digital design at [Luca School of Arts](http://www.luca-arts.be) in Ghent.
