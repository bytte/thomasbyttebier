# The bigger problem

I'm Thomas Byttebier. I studied design at the turn of the millennium and fell in love with the interactive nature of the web. I’ve grown to believe that design should be as simple and clear as possible. Users shouldn’t have to think to find their way. Fitbit fitbit. ffitbit Ffitbit

> It's simple. For security reasons all employees must use their badge once more to open the exit doors. I write the name of the missing employees on a piece of paper, then search this Access database that has all entrance and exit times in it. I then substract some minutes, write that time down again and input it in the software.


There’s so much to love about that story. For one, Bennett illustrates the prime reason we should never merely execute what we’re asked to design. This may seem counterintuitive, particularly if the question directly comes from our client, perhaps a field specialist or the product’s main stakeholder. But it is vital. In Bennett’s case Ideo would have designed a less usable device otherwise, leading to a worse patient experience.
When designing user interfaces, the same rule of thumb applies: never start designing anything until you deeply understand the problem at hand. Go back to research, talk to real users. Be that 3-year old kid again that answers every answer with another ‘why?’ until all conversations ultimately end at the beginning of the universe.
Why? Because a common and seemingly innocent question like: “Can you design this extra flow in the UI?”, is in fact an opinionated, misleading request. It inherently suggests a solution to a design problem you don’t fully grasp at this point in time. You’re not hired to add cosmetics to half-assed solutions, you’re here to solve users’ problems through design in the best possible way.

## Punching out

A few years ago I was consulted as a user interface designer for software that supports Human Resources divisions. One day I was asked to design a new workflow that would make it easier for users to find out where our software was missing required input. “It’s come to our attention that more and more users ask for functionality like that.”
That sounded like I needed to get some research done. During a field visit one user’s story grabbed my attention. She worked at a large healthcare company. She quietly told me that she was indeed searching and fixing missing required data each week day for about 3 hours a day. “I’m afraid we really need that lacking input, as our company can’t pay its employees’ salaries without it.”
