I am a freelance digital designer shaping, teaching and coding the web for almost two decades now. I want digital products to be delightful to use. I believe good design is inclusive, and reduces to the essence.

I design web sites and digital products. I research, talk to users, sketch flows and interactions. I prototype and test them. I simplify. I write accessible and semantic HTML and CSS.

I am currently Digital Director at [Base Design](https://basedesign.com). We work for institutions and brands such as Delvaux, Haus der Kunst, Musée Yves Saint Laurent, Fondation Cartier, Fondation Luma, Graanmarkt 13, Maison Dandoy and PSLab.

I am also lector digital design at [Luca School of Arts](http://www.luca-arts.be) in Ghent.

If you want to know more about me, here's a few key articles on [my blog]({{ site.baseurl }}/blog) that should give you an overall idea of my thoughts on digital and design:

Currently I fully focus on Base and Luca. [Send me an email](mailto:{{ site.email | encode_email }}) if you want to meet. I live in the beautiful city of Ghent in Belgium.
